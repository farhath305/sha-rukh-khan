    <h2>100 Years Ago...</h2>
    <p>People thought Earth was flat. They believed the sun was rotating around the Earth. And many of them were sure… science had already answered everything.<br>But look at us now — we laugh at them. But what if… 100 years from now… they laugh at us?</p>

    <h2>🧠 PART 1 – SCIENCE HAS LIMITS</h2>
    <p>Science is powerful. It’s given us medicine, rockets, AI. But let’s be real… science also has limits. There are sounds we can’t hear. Light we can’t see. Frequencies that pass through us, every second, but our eyes are blind to them.</p>

    <h2>🧘 PART 2 – CONSCIOUSNESS: THE BIG MYSTERY</h2>
    <p>What is consciousness? What is this "self" that watches our thoughts? We can feel emotions, dreams, memories, connection with the Divine. But where is this “self” located?</p>

    <h2>📌 PART 3 – THE UNSEEN (AL-GHAYB)</h2>
    <p>As Muslims, we’re told to believe in the unseen — Al-Ghayb. Allah says in the Quran: “Those who believe in the unseen...” (Surah Baqarah 2:3). Just because something isn’t visible to the eye… doesn’t mean it’s not real.</p>

    <h2>🕳️ PART 4 – WE MAY BE THE FOOLS</h2>
    <p>Imagine this: In 2124, people look back at us — they laugh at our limited science, our arrogance. Just like we laugh at people who thought Earth was the center of the universe.</p>

    <h2>🪞 PART 5 – BE HUMBLE, BE A SEEKER</h2>
    <p>Don’t worship science — respect it, but know its limits. Be a seeker — of truth, of light, of meaning. Combine faith and curiosity. Trust Allah, trust the Quran, and ask questions.</p>

    <h2>🗿 OUTRO</h2>
    <p>So next time you hear someone say, “I only believe what I can see…” Ask them: “Do you see your own thoughts?” My brother… my sister… There is more than this world. There is truth… beyond what we can see.</p>
